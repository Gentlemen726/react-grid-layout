### React-Grid-Layout

[View the Demo](https://strml.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/1-basic.html)

React-Grid-Layout is a grid layout system much like [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) or 
[Gridster](http://gridster.net), for React. 

RGL is not as full-featured as the above projects. However, it solves a major pain point I've found with those
projects - it is responsive! Try resizing the window in the demo and see how the grid resizes without any fuss.

RGL works just fine with server-side rendering.

RGL is React-only and does not require jQuery. It does (for the time being) require lodash.

More demos are coming soon. RGL supports adding and removing components without fuss.

If you have a feature request, add it as an issue.
